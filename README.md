– The programming language: C++

– Execute in Linux terminal.

– How to execute the program.

  Go into directory and run "make" command.
  Create a new window terminal at same directory.
  Then execute "./sender keyfile.txt" to send file to receiver.
  Until it notices "Wait until the receiver send us a message.", go to other window terminal.
  Now we could execute the receiver "./receiver" to read the message.
  It will run until notices finished IPC.
